# Cycles and Circuits

A comprehensive exploration of cycles and circuits in computer science and mathematics.

## Overview

This project investigates the fundamental concepts of cycles and circuits across various domains, including:
- Graph theory and algorithmic analysis
- Computational complexity and optimization
- Mathematical modeling of cyclic structures
- Hamiltonian and Eulerian graphs (circuits, cycles, loops, paths, etc.)

## Purpose

This project was meant as a practice coding project as well as an exploration into material I have a deep interest in. In attempting this project I:
- Practiced clean coding
- Improved my personal coding style
- Challenged myself to improve python fundamentals
- Created a working python application from start to finish

  ## Potential Future Applications

  This project could be expanded to include so many more features or used to practice additional skills in Python, including:
  - Graphics/UI interface
  - More graph theory concepts
  - Additional Python practice
